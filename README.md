# EvilCorp2000ProductsAPI

I created this project to write my own API with the help of another tutorial project and am planning to use this in a future bigger fun-project with business background.
This mini project is finished, since I'm still wirking with the tutorial.

### EvilCorp2000ProductsAPI
* ASP.NET Core Web API
* Serilog for files
* EF Core
* Attribute based Routing
* using JSONPatchDocument
* using AutoMapper
* Pagination
* Authentication for GetProductsById

### Programming concepts included 
* Repository pattern
* Dependency Injection
* Logging
* experimenting with Swagger & Postman

### Additional info
* I ended up not seeding the database because I already created it via MS SQLServer Management Studio
